## FOUNDATION OF DATA
The foundation of data refers to the basic principles and concepts that underpin how data is collected, managed, analyzed, and utilized in decision-making processes.
During the first week of training, we delved into several key topics, including data literacy, data generation, data sources, data structure, data storage, and data analysis. I gained an understanding of how organizations operate two primary systems: operational systems, which handle day-to-day transactions, and analytic systems, which focus on data insights and decision-making. A significant part of the discussions was centered on how to efficiently restructure and manage data using the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process, which plays a crucial role in transforming raw data into meaningful insights.

## Data Structure
 * Structured Data: Organized data, typically in rows and columns (e.g., databases, spreadsheets).
 * Unstructured Data: Data that doesn’t follow a specific format (e.g., text files, social media posts, videos).
 * Semi-Structured Data: Contains elements of both structured and unstructured data (e.g., XML, JSON).

## Data Storage
It can happen in two main ways:
1. **On-Premises**:  
   - Data is stored within the organization's servers.
   - Accessible only from within the organization.
   - Offers more control and security but requires more maintenance.
2. **Cloud**:  
   - Data is stored remotely in data centers accessed via the internet.
   - Accessible from anywhere with an internet connection.
   - Flexible and scalable but relies on external service providers.
  
## Data Analysis
Data Analysis helps businessess make informed decisions, understand customer behaviour, improve operations, and predict future trends.
  - Helps organizations make decisions based on actual data rather than intuition or guesswork.
  - Identifies inefficiencies in processes, leading optimization and cost reduction.
  - Identifies target markets and creating more effective marketing strategies.
  - Helps in assessing credit risk, fraud detection, and compliance with regulatory standards.
  - It can also enhance transparency with stakeholders, improving the company’s reputation and brand loyalty.
  - Data-driven insights can lead to the development of new products or services by identifying unmet customer needs or market gaps.

## TOOLS USED
  1. Micrsoft Excel for Data cleaning, Analysis, Visualization and Reporting
  2. SQL Server - Structured Query Language for Quering of Data
  3. GitHub for Portfolio Building
  4. Microsoft Power BI for ETL, Data Modeling, Analysis, Visualization and Reporting


## MICROSOFT EXCEL CLASS

### Excel Tools and Data Reporting
We explored Excel in depth, starting with data cleaning and manipulation using various formulas. One of the key focuses was learning how to manage data entry and apply data validation techniques to help minimize errors during the entry process. We practiced a variety of functions, including SUM, AVERAGE, SUMIF, IFS, MAXIF, and more. Cell referencing was introduced during our session on lookup functions. In our final lecture on Excel, we focused on reporting, where we covered how to create Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, and build comprehensive reports using these tools.
