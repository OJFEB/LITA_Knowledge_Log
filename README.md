### Project Title:Data Literacy and Excel Class

During the first week of training, we delved into several key topics, including data literacy, data generation, data sources, data structure, data storage, and data analysis. I gained an understanding of how organizations operate two primary systems: operational systems, which handle day-to-day transactions, and analytic systems, which focus on data insights and decision-making. A significant part of the discussions was centered on how to efficiently restructure and manage data using the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process, which plays a crucial role in transforming raw data into meaningful insights.
