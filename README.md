# Project Title: Data Literacy and Excel Class

OUTLINE


## FOUNDATION OF DATA
During the first week of training, we delved into several key topics, including data literacy, data generation, data sources, data structure, data storage, and data analysis. I gained an understanding of how organizations operate two primary systems: operational systems, which handle day-to-day transactions, and analytic systems, which focus on data insights and decision-making. A significant part of the discussions was centered on how to efficiently restructure and manage data using the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process, which plays a crucial role in transforming raw data into meaningful insights.


## TOOLS USED
- Micrsoft Excel for Data cleaning, Analysis, Visualization and Reporting
- SQL Server - Structured Query Language for Quering of Data
- GitHub for Portfolio Building
- Microsoft Power BI for ETL, Data Modeling, Analysis, Visualization and Reporting
  

## EXCEL TOOLS AND DATA REPORTING
We explored Excel in depth, starting with data cleaning and manipulation using various formulas. One of the key focuses was learning how to manage data entry and apply data validation techniques to help minimize errors during the entry process. We practiced a variety of functions, including SUM, AVERAGE, SUMIF, IFS, MAXIF, and more. Cell referencing was introduced during our session on lookup functions. In our final lecture on Excel, we focused on reporting, where we covered how to create Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, and build comprehensive reports using these tools.
